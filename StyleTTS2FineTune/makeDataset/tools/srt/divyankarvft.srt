00:00:04,334 --> 00:00:28,114
hello this is a recording of my voice that will be used to create a digital lightness a synthetic echo of how i sound the human voice is a remarkable instrument it's more than just a carrier of words it's a fundamental part of our identity woven into the fabric of our personality

2
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:50,136
it can command attention whisper a secret sing a melody or tell a story for the next several minutes I'll be reading a text designed to capture the unique qualities of my own voice its pitch its rhythm its particular texture

3
00:00:50,116 --> 00:01:13,440
the goal is to provide a rich and varied sample of speech let's begin the journey the very concept of voice synthesis used to be the stuff of science fiction we imagined robotic monotone assistants devoid of all human warmth yet here we are at a point

4
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:21,809
where technology can learn from just a few minutes of audio to reconstruct a voice with startling accuracy.

5
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:28,356
The process itself is a fascinating intersection of data, mathematics and artistry.

6
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:38,668
Every pause, every slight rise in inflection, every unique pronunciation becomes a data point in a vast digital tapestry.

7
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,752
This recording is my contribution to the tapestry.

8
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,906
So what does it truly mean to capture a voice?

9
00:01:49,787 --> 00:01:51,110
It begins with the basics.

10
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:52,873
Phonemes.

11
00:01:52,893 --> 00:01:54,636
The smallest units of sound.

12
00:01:55,598 --> 00:01:58,022
The crisp T in technology.

13
00:01:58,042 --> 00:02:01,227
The soft SH in ocean.

14
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:04,453
The vibrant vowel in amazing.

15
00:02:05,682 --> 00:02:16,874
A robust dataset must contain a balanced diet of these sounds, ensuring the model doesn't over-learn one sound while neglecting the other.

16
00:02:16,894 --> 00:02:32,770
This script, for example, intentionally includes words with tricky consonant clusters like strength, crisply, and sixths, alongside a wide spectrum of long and short vowel sounds.

17
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,288
Beyond individual sounds, there's the complex world of prosody.

18
00:02:40,308 --> 00:02:52,767
The challenge lies not in the mere application of words, but in the faithful reconstruction of the subtle music of speech that conveys emotion and intent.

19
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:54,489
How do I ask a question?

20
00:02:55,751 --> 00:03:01,660
Is my curiosity conveyed through a rising pitch at the end of a sentence?

21
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:08,450
When I state a fact with conviction, does my tone become more assertive and level?

22
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:16,021
For example, the statement, the sky is blue, delivered very differently from the sky is blue, isn't it?

23
00:03:17,203 --> 00:03:23,091
These are the nuances that separates a robotic voice from a truly lifelike one.

24
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:32,425
The dataset must contain dozens of examples of these different speech acts to build a truly flexible and expressive model.

25
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,749
And what about numbers and jargon?

26
00:03:36,511 --> 00:03:39,255
A versatile model needs to handle them with ease.

27
00:03:39,815 --> 00:03:48,488
For instance, the year 1984 should sound different from the number 1984.

28
00:03:48,468 --> 00:03:56,400
Technical terms like quantum entanglement or mitochondria require clear and precise articulation.

29
00:03:57,461 --> 00:04:09,379
Therefore, this recording will include a variety of numerical formats and specialized vocabulary to serve as a comprehensive linguistic blueprint for the artificial intelligence.

30
00:04:11,941 --> 00:04:18,069
But a voice isn't just a technical blueprint, it's the color plate of our emotions.

31
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:24,418
Think about the sheer range of feelings we convey without ever changing our words.

32
00:04:24,859 --> 00:04:34,472
The simple phrase, oh, that's just great, can be a genuine expression of joy, or it can be dripping with the heaviest sarcasm.

33
00:04:34,452 --> 00:04:36,455
How does a machine learn that?

34
00:04:36,475 --> 00:04:42,542
It learns from context, from miniscule shifts in timing, volume and pitch.

35
00:04:43,363 --> 00:04:45,226
What a remarkable challenge that is.

36
00:04:46,407 --> 00:04:52,054
I find it genuinely fascinating to consider how my own voice changes with my mood.

37
00:04:52,895 --> 00:04:56,980
When I'm excited, my pitch naturally rises and bass quickens.

38
00:04:57,261 --> 00:05:01,506
Listen, that's the most incredible thing I have seen all week.

39
00:05:01,486 --> 00:05:08,277
When I am thoughtful or serious, my voice might become lower, slower, more deliberate.

40
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,166
We must consider the ethical implications of this technology.

41
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:22,239
And when I am telling a story, I might use pauses to build suspense or raise my voice to emphasize a dramatic moment.

42
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,527
These emotional signatures are the most difficult to replicate.

43
00:05:27,507 --> 00:05:32,837
Yet, they are the most important for creating a truly believable synthetic voice.

44
00:05:33,638 --> 00:05:39,289
That's why this script isn't just a dry recitation of facts.

45
00:05:39,309 --> 00:05:42,475
It attempts to journey through different moods.

46
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:49,768
It contains moments of wonder, of serious contemplation, and of simple declarative joy.

47
00:05:49,748 --> 00:05:58,025
The hope is that the model doesn't just learn to speak my words but also learns a little something about the spirit in which I speak them.

48
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,514
It's the difference between a photograph and a painting.

49
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:07,504
One captures a perfect image and the other captures a feeling.

50
00:06:09,796 --> 00:06:37,491
let me tell you a short story to illustrate these points once a young cartographer named elara lived in the city of silent great hours her greatest ambition was to create a map not of not of lands but of sounds she would spend her days in the bustling marketplace transcribing the energetic haggling of 
the merchants she

51
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:46,439
She would visit the quiet libraries to document the gentle rustle of turning pages and the soft scholarly whispers.

52
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:53,727
She believed that the soundscape of a city was its truest portrait.

53
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:59,614
One day she met an old clockmaker who had lost his voice to a mysterious illness.

54
00:07:00,927 --> 00:07:05,216
He communicated through intricate gestures and written notes.

55
00:07:05,236 --> 00:07:14,396
He explained to Ilara that what he missed most wasn't shouting but the simple act of humming a tune while he worked.

56
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:17,723
It was the quiet, personal sounds that he longed for.

57
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,910
This gave Ilara an idea.

58
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:28,819
Using her vast knowledge of acoustics and a collection of resonant crystals, she built a device.

59
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:44,315
It couldn't replicate his speech, but by analyzing his old journals, his word choices, his sentence structures, it could generate a unique melody, a song of the self that captured the rhythm and spirit of his lost voice.

60
00:07:45,176 --> 00:07:50,442
The first time the old man heard it, he closed his eyes and smiled.

61
00:07:50,422 --> 00:08:10,894
single tear tracing a path through the workshop dust this story whether factual or fictional highlights a profound truth the technologies we build especially those that touch something as personal as the human voice are at their best when they don't just replicate but connect

62
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:18,056
They bridge the gap between silence and sound, between memory and reality.

63
00:08:18,076 --> 00:08:22,048
They serve not just a functional purpose but an emotional one.

64
00:08:23,395 --> 00:08:47,260
so this recording is now drawing to a close we have journeyed through technical explanations emotional reflections and even a short story we have covered a wide range of phonetic and prosodic ground every word spoken has been a contribution to the complex data set required for this fascinating 
process

65
00:08:47,240 --> 00:09:01,245
The idea that these sound waves captured right now by this microphone will be analyzed, deconstructed and used to teach a machine to speak as I do is quite simply extraordinary.

66
00:09:01,947 --> 00:09:11,003
It is a testament to human ingenuity and our endless quest to understand and replicate the world around us.

67
00:09:12,907 --> 00:09:16,915
This concludes the 16 minute voice recording for the fine tuning process.

68
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,023
Thank you.
